- **Alerts:** Notifications for unusually busy hours or days.
- **Proximity Search:** Find venues within a specific distance radius.
- **User Reviews:** Detailed reviews from other parents and caregivers.
- **Venue Requests:** Users can request to add new venues through a form on the website.

## backend work
<br>

1. language-wise organisation (keep track of requirements.txt and all this version stuff)
2. infrastructure (docker containers will do the trick, do not forget to remove pandas from the requirements)
3. 

- need to adapt the dockerfile to the actual versions of what we're using 
- need to set the requirements.txt
