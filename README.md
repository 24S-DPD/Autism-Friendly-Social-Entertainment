once we start putting places, we need to maintain the same database on every computer where the app is tested <br>
should we even stick to sqlite?

## backend work
<br>

1. language-wise organisation (keep track of requirements.txt and all this version stuff)
2. infrastructure (docker containers will do the trick, do not forget to remove pandas from the requirements)
3. 

<br>dont forget:
<code>python3 -m venv venv</code> to maintain the same version of python on each of our computer to avoid fastapi not working
<br><br>
- need to adapt the dockerfile to the actual versions of what we're using 
- need to set the requirements.txt
